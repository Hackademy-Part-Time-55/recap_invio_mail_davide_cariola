                                <p>Hey, I am Jermaine, 24 years old and freshly graduated from my Communication Design studies. My mother is from South Korea and Christian, my dad is from Ghana and Muslim. I live here in Hamburg, Germany, and I'm trying to be myself to the fullest extent.</p>
                                <p><strong>What are you doing here and tell us who you really are?</strong></p>
                                <p>Iâ€™m a Junior Designer at Hyperfocus, diving into the world of design with passion and curiosity. Who am I? A creative who loves making things, whether itâ€™s design, music, photography, or fashion.</p>
                                <p><strong>How did you come to work with Hyperfocus?</strong></p>
                                <p>After finishing my studies, I was eager to find a space that matched my creative vision. My mentor, Alexander Meinhardt, highly recommended Hyperfocus. After a few inspiring chats with the team at one of his events, it felt like the perfect fit.</p>"

                                <p>Our coâ€‘founder Paul stood on stage at the ADC Artificial Realities in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany and hosted a panel of two incredible guests: Iskra Velichkova Kleinanzeigen &amp; Roger Dudler Frontify. They were welcomed by a packed auditorium of hungry attendees wanting to hear something new and exciting about AI in branding.</p>
                                <p>We can safely say, the talk did not disappointâ€”an honest and emotional discussion lit the room with energy and intrigue. The perspective from Iskra was powerful, Roger brought his fears and woes to the table, but also painted a brighter, more optimistic future.</p>
                                <p>A big thank you to the Art Directors Club (ADC) and to Burkhard MÃ¼ller for inviting us.</p>"

                                <p>I'm Tra Giang Nguyen, a creative thinker known as Gydient. I value clarity, so when I stepped into the creative industry, I inked â€˜NO BULLSHITâ€™ on my left arm.</p>
                                <p><strong>What are you doing here and tell us who you really are?</strong></p>
                                <p>Iâ€™m joining Hyper as a Design Director, and Iâ€™m eager to contribute my sharp skills in building brand concepts, delivering topâ€‘notch design, and creating a multidisciplinary toolkit with a strong design direction.</p>
                                <p>Besides, I love brands and products that display intelligent, witty creativity. Being creative means tackling old problems with a fresh approach.</p>

                                <p>One sunny day, I dropped by the office, had a chat with the team, and everything just clicked.</p>"

                                <p>This one is quite special! We won the prestigious RedDot Award for our work with Heimplanet. We have had a relationship with them in various guises for the past couple of years. This award is kind of an accumulation of that, but the work that was judged was from a recent refresh of the brand. We undertook the task of reworking the foundations of the brand that we had already created.</p>
                                <p>Building on the foundations we reimagined the whole design system and organised the fundamentals, created a new tone of voice, and made sense of the brand. A big clean up and a razorâ€‘sharp brand platform was built to unify the entire team.</p>
                                <p>The RedDot is something quite special as it stands for innovation and design at the highest standards. Many products, people and projects that have inspired us as creatives have been awarded the RedDot, so this is quite the celebration for Hyperfocus. Super chuffed ðŸ™‚</p>
